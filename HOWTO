I try to specify 
#!/bin/sh in my scripts which uses the standard Unix shell based on 
the IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 known as the POSIX standard.
This derives from the original "Bourne shell" and is 
supposed to be more portable.
I try to avoid features of other shell scripts.
Depending on your operating system this may be symbolically linked to 
other shells - particularly bash.

"Unix Shell Programming", 3rd edition, by Stephen Kochan 
and Patrick Wood has been my goto desk reference for shell scripts 
for many years.

It now has a 4th edition published in 2017 entitled
"Shell Programming in Unix, Linux and OS X". This seems to be 
pretty similar to the 4th edition, except the Monument Valley cover.

The Wikipedia article on "Shell script",
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_script
is a good starting point.
The following has some discussion of why to try and stick to 
the standard
